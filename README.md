IMDb, in full Internet Movie Database, Web site that provides information about millions of films and television programs as well as their cast and crew

IMDb stands for Internet Movie Database. It is an online database of information related to films, television series, home videos, 
video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.
IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group “rec. arts. movies” in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, 
it has been owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
